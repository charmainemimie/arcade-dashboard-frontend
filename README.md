# 🎮 Miracle Arcade Frontend

---

 Welcome to the **Miracle Arcade** frontend, a project born from my deep passion to bring joy, fun, and technology to my hometown, **Chivhu**. This lively town is full of **jovial kids, energetic teens, and fun-loving adults**, all of whom deserve a space to laugh, compete, and connect. Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **Shadcn**, and **Vite**, this modern web interface lays the foundation for a future gaming arcade where the community can explore exciting games, reserve play sessions, and stay updated on events and location details. This is more than just code, it's a dream in the making for Chivhu.
