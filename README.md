# 🎮 Miracle Arcade Dashboard Frontend

---

 Welcome to the **Miracle Arcade Dashboard** frontend, a project born from my deep passion to bring joy, fun, and technology to my hometown, **Chivhu**. This lively town is full of **jovial kids, energetic teens, and fun-loving adults**, all of whom deserve a space to laugh, compete, and connect. Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **Shadcn**, and **Vite**.
